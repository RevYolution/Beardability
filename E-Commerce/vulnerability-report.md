## Injection

### Exposure 

- Injection occurs when attacker send untrusted data to an interpreter as a command. This data can trick the interpreter into running code or accessing data without the proper authorization.
- Injection would have potentially been able to access user information such as usernames and passwords. It could also have access to our databases to corrupt them making our site unusable. 

### Repair

- We insured that this was not present by password hashing. This is a given feature within Identity.

## Broken Authentication

### Exposure

- Broken Authentication occurs when authentication is not implemented correctly and attackers are able to compromise users information. This can include passwords, keys or tokens. 
- Broken Authentication could have been present during our login process, not logging out correctly or not proporly hashing and salting passwords. 

### Repair

- Identity takes care of our hashing and salting passwords. We should add in auto logout functionallity to our application to help protect our users from improper logouts. This will allow us more protection from previous authenticaitons carrying over and being stolen.
