## Injection

### Exposure 

- Injection occurs when attacker send untrusted data to an interpreter as a command. This data can trick the interpreter into running code or accessing data without the proper authorization.
- Injection would have potentially been able to access user information such as usernames and passwords. It could also have access to our databases to corrupt them making our site unusable. 

### Repair
